# Azure Machine Learning Data Loss Prevention (Preview)

## What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?

AzureML has an outbound dependency to storage.reigon/*.blob.core.windows.net. This configuration increases the risk of allowing malicious users to move the data from your virtual network to other storage accounts in the same region. Current preview is for removing its dependency.

**No Public IP Compute Instance and Compute Cluster does not support DLP.**

## Steps to use DLP

## Example Architecture

## 1. Enable Your Subscription for Opt-in Preview
Submit [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/1TraBek7LV) to allowlist your subscription(s). Microsoft will contact with you when its allowlisting is finished.

**We need your batch account for this preview. Create a workspace and an compute instance before submitting a form if you have never done that with your subscription. You can delete resources immediately.**

## 2. Change You Inbound and Outbound Configurations

### Inbound Configurations
* Allow the inbound from service tag "Azure Machine Learning" (No Change)
* If you use a firewall, you need to configure UDR to make inbound communication skip your firewall. See [this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-secure-training-vnet?tabs=azure-studio%2Cipaddress#inbound-traffic).

Note that the inbound from service tag "Batch node management" is not required anymore.

### Outbound Configurations

#### NSG Case
* Destination port 443 over TCP to BatchNodeManagement.region 
* Destination port 443 over TCP to Storage.region (Service Endpoint Policy will narrow it down in the later step.) 

#### FW Case
* Destination port 443 to region.batch.azure.com, region.service.batch.com.
* Destination port 443 over TCP to *.blob.core.windows.net, *.queue.core.windows.net, *.table.core.windows.net (SEP will narrow it down in the later step.)

### Service Endpoint Policy Configuration

We use [service endpoint policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoint-policies-overview) to narrow down the target storage accounts of the outbound to storage.region/*.blob.core.windows.net.

* Enable the storage service endpoint of your subnet has your compute
* Create a service endpoint policy with **/services/Azure/MachineLearning** alias and one storage account. At least one stroage account registration is required for a service endpoint policy. If you have a private endpoint for your default storage account attached to AzureML workspace, you do not need to include the default storage account in SEP.
* Attach your service endpoint policy to your subnet has your compute.

If you do not have storage private endpoints for Azure Machine Learning Vnet, you need to do the following.
* Add your storage accounts in your service endpoint policy that you want to allow access from your compute. At least, you need to add the default storage account attached to your AzureML workspace.

## Curated Environments
If you use curated enviornments, please make sure using the latest one and it is on Microsoft Container Registry. If the link under Azure contaier registry is mcr.microsoft.com/*, you are good to go. If the link is viennaglobal.azurecr.io/*, you cannot use it with DLP. That curated environment is on the deprecation path, or on the migration to MCR.
